# Athena üåô

Athena is a web application developed in [Python](https://www.python.org/) / [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) / [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) that has two faces.

**GOOD**: Tries to code with secure development best practices in mind.

**BAD**: Tries to code like (possibly) you.

- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard :

  The "GOOD" version (not finished yet) will comply with the [OWASP ASVS:](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project)

  This will permit learn how to develop python code following the best security practices.



## Installation üíº

- With a simple steps you can install Athena and also run it :
- First you need to use a linux distro ( As example : Kali linux or ubuntu.... )
- Install both of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
```
      pip install Flask
      
      sudo apt install sqlite3
```
- Then Clone the project into your directory :
```  
      git clone https://github.com/GDGSNF/Athena.git
      
      cd Athena
      
      pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```      
  - After Installing the Project Now you will be able to do some steps to run Athena :
```  
      sudo ./install.sh
``` 

   - And the key will be registred and you can run now Athena!
    
### Take care!!

- If you found a key or a registry id that devl@kali not the creator report on issues or contact Me :
- Exemple of key :
```
ED44FF07D8D0BF6
Kali linux Repository<devel@Kali.org>
```

## Database Initialization üìÖ

Both, "BAD" and "GOOD" versions, requires an initialization of the database.

This is done with the script "db_init.py" inside each of the directories (bad, and good).

Each version has their own sqlite files for the users and posts.

The execution of the script is, for example:
```
    cd bad
    ./db_init.py
```
Or :
```
    cd good
    ./db_init.py
```

## Features üîë

- Login/Logout
- Read posts from other users
- Publish posts
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- API for read and write posts
- Content Security Policy
- SSL/TLS Server


## [Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/GDGSNF/Athena/blob/main/bad/README.md) üî•

Some of the vulnerabilities present on the "BAD" version:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Session Impersonation
- Insecure Deserialization
- Authentication Bruteforce
- Authentication Bypass

**Note:** The "GOOD" version (not finished yet) is supposed to don't have vulnerabilities, but I'm a human being, so...

## Default Credentials üêç

After database initialization, three users are created:

| Username |    Password   |
|----------|:-------------:|
| admin    |  SuperSecret  |
| elliot   |    123123123  |
| tim      | 12345678      |
 
You can login with any user, the application doesn't have a permissions system, so, the three have the same permissions.
